# Main Route Registration Fix for Dev Legal Website

## Issue Identified

The 404 error on the homepage was caused by a critical omission in the application factory: the main routes defined in `src/routes/main.py` were never registered with the Flask application.

## The Problem

In the Flask application structure:
1. The main routes (including the homepage route `/`) are defined in a function called `register_main_routes(app)` in `src/routes/main.py`
2. This function needs to be explicitly called in the application factory (`create_app()` in `src/__init__.py`)
3. Only the blueprint routes (blog, admin, api) were being registered, but not the main routes

## The Solution

The fix was implemented by adding the following code to the `create_app()` function in `src/__init__.py`:

```python
# Register main routes
from src.routes.main import register_main_routes
register_main_routes(app)
```

This code was added after the blueprint registration and before the error handlers registration.

## Why This Works

Flask routes can be registered in two ways:
1. Using blueprints (which are registered with `app.register_blueprint()`)
2. Directly on the application object (using `@app.route()`)

The main routes in this application use the second approach, which requires explicitly calling the registration function that contains the route decorators.

## Preventing Future Issues

When working with Flask applications that use a combination of blueprints and direct route registration:
1. Always ensure that all route registration functions are called in the application factory
2. Check that the homepage route (`/`) is properly registered
3. Test all main routes after deployment

This fix ensures that all routes in the application are properly registered and accessible.
