# Admin Template Endpoint Fix for Dev Legal Website

## Issue Identified

The 500 error when accessing the admin dashboard after login was caused by an incorrect endpoint reference in the admin template. The template was trying to use `url_for('admin.index')`, but the correct endpoint name is `admin.dashboard`.

## The Problem

In the Flask application structure:
1. The admin dashboard route is defined as `@admin_bp.route('/')` with the function name `dashboard()` in `src/routes/admin.py`
2. This creates an endpoint named `admin.dashboard`, not `admin.index`
3. The template in `src/templates/admin/index.html` was incorrectly using `url_for('admin.index')` which doesn't exist

## The Solution

The fix was implemented by updating the template to use the correct endpoint name:

```html
<!-- Changed from -->
<li><a href="{{ url_for('admin.index') }}" class="{{ 'active' if request.endpoint == 'admin.index' else '' }}">
    <i class="fas fa-tachometer-alt"></i> Dashboard
</a></li>

<!-- Changed to -->
<li><a href="{{ url_for('admin.dashboard') }}" class="{{ 'active' if request.endpoint == 'admin.dashboard' else '' }}">
    <i class="fas fa-tachometer-alt"></i> Dashboard
</a></li>
```

Additionally, we updated the condition that checks for the active state to match the correct endpoint name.

## Why This Works

In Flask, endpoint names are derived from the blueprint name and the function name that handles the route. When using `@admin_bp.route('/')` with a function named `dashboard()`, the endpoint becomes `admin.dashboard`, not `admin.index`.

## Preventing Future Issues

When working with Flask templates and URL generation:
1. Always ensure that endpoint names in `url_for()` calls match the actual route function names
2. Be careful with function naming in route definitions, as they directly affect endpoint names
3. Use consistent naming conventions for routes and their corresponding templates
4. Test navigation links after making changes to route definitions

This fix ensures that the admin dashboard is accessible after login, and all navigation within the admin interface works correctly.
